sceneTransferApp is a desktop app in development to facilitate the correct formatting of media directories.

Media directory formatting can be time consuming and repetitive.  The aim of this project is to automate said task via a friendly user interface that can take care of multiple project directories at once.

Original idea by Alberto Cuadra.
Currently in development by Nicolás Mariñelarena.
